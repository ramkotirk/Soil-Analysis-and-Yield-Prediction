Differential Evolution for finding Cluster Heads:

UPDATE: due to high demand for cleaner, effective(easy to read) and optimized code, I have implemented a multi-threaded version of this algorithm in c++. Do feel to check it out, [here](https://github.com/vitalbullet/Soil-Analysis-and-Yield-Prediction-II)
